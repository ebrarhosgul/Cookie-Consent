<h1 align="center" style="color:#777;"> üç™ Cookie Consent </h1>


## :memo: Description

I developed a basic Cookie Consent modal. This cookie consent modal asks for a name and email address from the user. It does not make it possible to reject or close the form. After the user enters and accepts their information, a loading screen appears and a screen containing the entered name is displayed. After this screen, the modal can be closed.

I used Figma file to planning and I designed it according to the desired dimensions. You can test this project by following [this link](https://ebrar-cookie-consent.netlify.app/).
